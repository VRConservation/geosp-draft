# Pros & Cons

## Open source vs. paid
Navigating the world of open source and subscription-based geospatial tools is challenging. It can also be costly when you pay for software, imagery, and technicians to conduct your analyses. 
## False dichotomy
In truth, it's a false dichotomy to pit FOSS vs. paid geospatial tools. Your work flow may involve data analysis in GEE then import datasets into ArcGIS pro for further analysis and creating layouts, web apps or online maps. You may find that working with many government agencies requires use of Arc products because it's what their employees know and their agencies have license to use (*see the [Modern Geospatial](https://mapscaping.com/podcast/modern-geospatial/) Mapscaping Podcast on using FOSS with different organizations*). 

## Table
Below is a non-exhaustive and very brief guide to some of the more commonly used products available. They are also, mostly, software or packages that I have used or tested.

Desktop software not the future of geospatial. | Lowest cost annual license abut $100 (students and non-commercial use), business licenses are >$1,600 and up.         |
| Felt                      | Easy to get started and use, good how to descriptions, great visualization. Support QGIS and integrate map export from QGIS to Felt.                                                                                                                                                                 | Expensive, proprietary software, sharing files and maps?

| Earth Blox                | Awsome idea of code blocks that fit together like a puzzle to analyze and visualize geospatial data, especially GEE. Easier to upload data than GEE. Soutions and packages pre-coded and loaded. Support seems strong.                                                                               | Expensive, proprietary software. The version I tested in 2023 was slower than GEE.                                                                                                                                                 | Not transparent about pricing (no info on website). A web search and previous conversation put is at ~$2,400/user/yr. |
| CARTO                     | I haven't used CARTO but it looks amazing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Proprietary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Not clear.

| Post-GIS                  | Easy to download, set up and run queries on spatial data, documentation and tutorials good. Connects to PostgreSQL for analysis beyond spatial data. Easily connects to desktop software such as QGIS. Industry standard for spatial sql.                                                            | Use with Docker is necessary and semi-faffy, but not too difficult. Still learning to use this software, so more cons to come (if any).                                                                                            | Free                                                                                                                  |
| Leafmap                   | Fills the geospatial analysis gap for non GEE users. Easy to use, many features require one line of coding, awesome documentation, tutorials, and videos.                                                                                                                                            | Setup via CLI, IDE, and for Windows users can be challenging (but great videos and tutorials are available on how to do it).                                                                                                       | Free                                                                                                                  |
| Geemap                    | Incredible Python package and the best/easiest way to use GEE. Great support, videos, tutorials, and book to get you started and advance to more complex use. Connected to Open Geospatial Solutions and GISWQS (Quisheng Wu) so new developments are imminent. Also, integrated into GEE and Colab. | Setup via CLI, IDE, and for Windows users can be challenging (but great videos and tutorials are available on how to do it).                                                                                                       | Free                                                                                                                  |
| R, RStudio                | Widely accepted code and platform by the scientific community, easy to use, many plug-ins, great tutorials and documentation. Handles geospatial, 3d, imagery/Lidar, and geostatistics well.                                                                                                         | Not widely used outside of academia, but use is increasing. Some visualization can be clunky or time consuming to develop.                                                                                                         | R                                                                                                                     |
