    "## Scenario\n",
    "You need to do a quick exploratory data analysis of above and below ground carbon biomass for an area of interest near Lake Tahoe in the Central Sierra, California. A donor has asked you to this by end of the week. You go down the hall to the right where the map plotters are and ask the GIS guy. He peers up above his array of screens, wipes his mouth and goatee with a bit of his somewhat tatty Missile Command t-shirt and tries not to look exasperated when you ask him about some help. He's busy, he's working on a dozen other projects, he might be able to get you something in 2 weeks. \n",

    "The GIS guy mumbles look it up on Google Earth Engine. Yes you've heard of this, you're thinking Google Earth, it will be easy, but you check out Earth Engine and find a console with an empty map and the required Javascript codingis another universe, let alone language, to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## DIY\n",
    "OK, so this is even if you have a GIS guy down the hall with the defunct plotter. Many of you are too small and can't afford to pay someone or a consultant to do your geospatial analysis. So how do you DIY it? Free and open source software (FOSS), or FOSS4G when it refers to free and open source geospatial, is readily available, and, much better than a costly yearly subscription fee it is free. Contrary to popular opinion, it's not that difficult to start. Here's how:\n",

You can search for any set in the catalog, click on sample and get an instantaneous view of the data. In reality, this is almost akin to no-code. It also computes and adds any layer in the cloud, so it doesn't matter how old or slow your computer is, you can run everything on Google servers.

This book is worth reading as a remote sensing textbook and guides you through how to nearly everything from basic to complex using Earth Engine. For answers to many other questions the Google Earth Engine Developers [listserv](https://groups.google.com/g/google-earth-engine-developers) is quite useful."
