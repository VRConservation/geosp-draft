# Pros & Cons

## Open source vs. paid
Navigating the world of open source and subscription-based geospatial tools is challenging. It can also be costly when you pay for software, imagery, and technicians to conduct your analyses. 

## False dichotomy
In truth, it's a false dichotomy to pit FOSS vs. paid geospatial tools. Your work flow may involve data analysis in GEE then import datasets into ArcGIS pro for further analysis and creating layouts, web apps or online maps. You may find that working with many government agencies requires use of Arc products because it's what their employees know and their agencies have license to use (*see the [Modern Geospatial](https://mapscaping.com/podcast/modern-geospatial/) Mapscaping Podcast on using FOSS with different clients*).
