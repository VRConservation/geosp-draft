## Why this book
There are a lot of geospatial resources, tutorials, and books out there but most focus on specific tools, such as Spatial SQL by Matt Forrest or the Google Earth Engine remote sensing book at eefa.org. This book is a resource to provide a beginners guide to getting going with each of those and compare free and open source software to paid resources and books.

Chatgpt intro:
'In today's world, conservation scientists face numerous challenges in their efforts to protect and preserve our natural environment. One of the most critical aspects of their work involves utilizing geospatial data to understand ecosystems, track wildlife, and identify areas in need of conservation action. However, accessing, processing, and analyzing geospatial data can be daunting tasks, often hindered by issues such as data accessibility, compatibility, and cost constraints.

The "Navigating Geospatial Data Challenges in Conservation Science" series aims to address these challenges head-on by providing practical solutions and inspirational success stories. Through six insightful articles, the series guides conservation scientists on their journey to effectively harness geospatial data using free and open-source software tools.'
