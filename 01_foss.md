# FOSS
Free and open source software

Anita Graser for FOSS quote

Is it really either/or to analyze and visualize geospatial data?
See the [Awesome-GEE](https://github.com/opengeos/Awesome-GEE?tab=readme-ov-file#r) repo for a curated list of GEE resources: 

You do a little more research and start to uncover no-code solutions to geospatial analysis.  
## Free vs No Code
Not really either/or

Break up sections into numbered paragraphs rather than long paragraphs

## The no-code time saving myth



## Participatory

PRA and RRA

Diversity Equity

Participation and videos from Arc government conference

Ask Leander and Elizabeth to write a DEI/Community participation chapter?
