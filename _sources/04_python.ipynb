    "\n",
    "Python is widely applicable and used in the geospatial community. ArcGIS Pro has a python package called Arcpy and QGIS has a packaged named PYQGIS. However, Arcpy is not easy or intuitive to use, even though it's a python package. I tried it, I read an entire book on it, I struggled using the notebooks, which are slow to load and not easy to link to VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I found geemap and leafmap, incredible user friendly python packages developed by Qiushen Wu and available on github at GISWQS, along with clear tutorials at leafmap.org and geemap.org and videos at [Open Geospatial Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/@giswqs). Many analyses require only one line of code. Here, geospatial analysis using scripts just clicked for me and it opened up another world to using Python to rapidly analyse data.\n",

Note when programmers say to uncomment a line, in python it means removing the hashtag before the command, or click on the line and hit control or command plus back slash (/). \n",
